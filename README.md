- 👋 Hi, I’m @BadSkyFate
-   Nice to meet you, I am establishing my first repository.
- 👀 I’m interested in fine tuning programming. That is probably going to change later on though because I am only just starting to learn how to code in school.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, VB and Website design.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small easy programs for now.
- 📫 How to reach me: message me on github, er I think they have a messaging system.
