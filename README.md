-   # ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Paul
-   Nice to meet you, I am learning everything I need to get a callback from any remote coding job that will have me.
-   Please suggest coding languages and frameworks for me to learn. I will learn them and I will be that much more employable.
-   So far, I have applied to over 100 computer-related jobs over the past 3 years and no one has called me back.
-   I have no personal or professional connections to the digital world.
-   I am very excited to get things started and work remotely.
-   Please message me on my Linkdin: www.linkedin.com/in/skyfateworks.
-   Happy coding!
